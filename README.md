My ever supportive brother-in-law turned brother encouraged me to learn DevOps and I promised not to let him down. Despite my tight schedule I will still make out time to get the best out of this class.

What really motivated me to learn DevOps, is the monetary aspect, also DevOps covers the whole software development life cycle.  As a DevOps engineer you can have a huge business impact in your company by having a good understanding of the whole software development life cycle and improving and optimizing it. And this again can be super fulfilling to know that your work has such an impact and affects many people eventually.
