What really motivated me to learn DevOps, is the monetary aspect, also DevOps covers the whole software development life cycle.  As a DevOps engineer you can have a huge business impact in your company by having a good understanding of the whole software development life cycle and improving and optimizing it. And this again can be super fulfilling to know that your work has such an impact and affects many people eventually.

I have spent most of my career working in teams where I've always been in collaboration with DevOps<sup>👨‍🔧</sup> and Machine Learning<sup>🦸‍♀️</sup> Engineers, and my interaction with these individuals has seen me develop so much interest🧡 in what they do. My convictions became clearer on the path to follow while working on a project🛠 recently where I got better exposure to the ineresting stuffs that go behind a stable💪🏿, secure🥷🏽, and functional🦬 solution. I've found myself more interested in activities related to DevOps than my current role, and this interest drives my commitment towards gaining the knowledge required to take up a DevOps role 🎒.
